Before
sp ->   [ 0]  (d0,50,0,-1) -> (Ov1,50, 0, 2) -> (Ov2,50, 0, 3) -> (Ov3,20, 0, -1)
        [ 1]  (d1,0,1012,-1)
        [ 2]  (d2,60,0,-1) -> (Ov4,40, 0, -1)

After 

        [ 0]  (d0,50,0,-1) -> (Ov1,50, 0, 2) -> (Ov2,0, 1012, 3) -> (Ov3,10, 0, -1)
sp ->   [ 1]  (d1,0,1012,-1)
        [ 2]  (d2,60,0,-1) -> (Ov4,40, 0, -1)
        [ 3]  (d3,2,989,-1)
        [ 4]  (d3,50,0,-1) -> (what is the supposed to be pid?,10, 0, -1)

File overflow content

ov1(1024), ov2(1024)(empty, ov3(1024), ov4(1024), 

Despite that you say in spec that "This is ok if they are eventually used to hold more tuples.", we do not
know if there are more tuples waiting to be inserted. 

So do we need to delete empty page Ov2? 
Also, in disk file, do we need to move ov3 and ov4 backward leaving no fragment space?

Similar question about tuples in one page. For example "Tuple 1, Tuple 2, Tuple3". After splitting, Tuple 2 is moved.
So there are fragment space between Tuple 1 and Tuple3. How to deal with the fragment?

Do we need to rename ov3 as ov2 and ov4 as ov3?
